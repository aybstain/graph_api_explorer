## Description

This project retrieves and analyzes Instagram influencer data using the Facebook Graph API. It collects information such as follower count, engagement rate, media types, captions, and hashtags used in the captions. The data is processed and visualized using Python libraries like requests, pandas, plotly, matplotlib, and wordcloud.

## Prerequisites
